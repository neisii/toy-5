This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this long conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked for a summary of the 03-shopping-mall project progress
2. **Documentation Discovery**: I found that search functionality was NOT missing - it was already implemented in Phase 2
3. **Documentation Structure Discussion**: User and I discussed how PROGRESS.md vs PHASE_*_PLAN/SUMMARY.md should work
4. **File Organization Decision**: We established a clear documentation hierarchy:
   - PROGRESS.md: Brief phase summaries
   - PHASE_N_PLAN.md: Detailed pre-phase planning
   - PHASE_N_SUMMARY.md: Detailed post-phase retrospective
   - RETROSPECTIVE.md: Overall project learning retrospective
   - SESSION_CONTEXT.md: Claude session context
5. **Documentation Reorganization**: 
   - Moved all root-level PROGRESS.md files to docs/RETROSPECTIVE.md
   - Created docs/PROGRESS.md for 02-weather-app
   - Updated templates and SESSION_CONTEXT files
6. **Screenshot Feature Request**: User asked if I could create screenshots for project READMEs
7. **Screenshot Implementation for 01-todo-app**: Successfully created 6/8 screenshots
8. **User Satisfaction**: User was pleased with results and requested the same for 02-weather-app, 03-shopping-mall, 04-auth-form
9. **Screenshot Work in Progress**: 
   - 02-weather-app: Only 2 screenshots succeeded
   - 03-shopping-mall: Hit port conflicts
   - User revealed they had servers running, causing the conflicts

Key technical decisions:
- Documentation structure finalized
- Screenshot testing strategy using Playwright's page.screenshot()
- API mocking for consistent screenshots

Current state: Working on shopping-mall screenshots but hit port conflicts due to user's running servers. Need to identify which ports are available.

Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
   - Initially: Summarize 03-shopping-mall project progress
   - Discovered search functionality was already implemented (not missing as documented)
   - Established documentation structure rules across all projects
   - Reorganize all project documentation to follow new structure
   - Create screenshot testing for visual documentation in READMEs
   - Generate screenshots for 01-todo-app, 02-weather-app, 03-shopping-mall, 04-auth-form

2. **Key Technical Concepts**:
   - AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle) methodology
   - Playwright E2E testing and screenshot capabilities

     3. **Documentation Structure**:
        - **PROGRESS.md**: 전체 Phase 간결한 요약 (Phase별 5-10줄)
        - **PHASE_N_PLAN.md**: Phase 시작 전 상세 계획 (요구사항, 기술적 접근, 예상 이슈)
        - **PHASE_N_SUMMARY.md**: Phase 완료 후 상세 회고 (구현 내용, 트러블슈팅, 코드 예시)
        - **RETROSPECTIVE.md**: 전체 프로젝트 학습 회고 (학습 포인트, 재사용 패턴, 통계)
        - **SESSION_CONTEXT.md**: Claude 세션용 스냅샷 (현재 상태, 다음 작업)
     ```

   - Automated screenshot generation process (6/8 success rate for todo-app)
   - Ongoing: Resolving port conflicts for shopping-mall screenshots
   - Need to identify which ports user's servers are using (5173 confirmed for todo-app)

6. **All User Messages**:
   - "현재까지 03-shopping-mall 프로젝트 진행 상황 요약"
   - "검색 기능 왜 누락되었지? 검색 기능 개발 전혀 안된 상태인지 확인해줘"
   - "검색 기능 아마 Phase 3나 4 단계에서 작업한 기능일 거야. 03-shopping-mall/docs/PROGRESS.md과 커밋 이력이랑 파일 생성일자까지 체크해서 해당 페이즈 별 문서에 정리한 다음 세션 컨텍스트를 업데이트 해줘."
   - "내가 파일명을 모호하게 알려줬네, 다시 물어볼게. [PHASE_N_PLAN/SUMMARY 설명 요청]"
   - "오, 네가 정리한 거 맘에 들어, 이행!"
   - "그리고 각 파일이 어떤 역할인지 설명한 것도 README.md에 적어주면 좋을 듯"
   - "지금까지 한 작업 커밋 하고 원격 푸시까지 한 다음, 내 질문에 응답해줘. 질문: 앱의 기능 별로 화면 스크린샷 촬영해서 각 프로젝트 별 소개 이미지로 저장할 수 있니?"
   - "01-todo-app 하나만 진행해보자, 결과물 보고 내가 만족하면 다른 프로젝트도 진행할 거야."
   - "오...생각보다 괜찮네,02-weather-app, 03-shopping-mall, 04-auth-form 모두 이행!"
   - "shopping-mall인데 좀비 프로세스로 남아있지 않은지 확인해봐"
   - "내가 띄워둔 서버가 있어서 포트 충돌한 거야"

7. **Pending Tasks**:
   - Complete 03-shopping-mall screenshot generation (interrupted by port conflict)
   - Complete 04-auth-form screenshot generation
   - Update README.md files for 02-weather-app (with 2 screenshots)
   - Update README.md for 03-shopping-mall (once screenshots complete)
   - Update README.md for 04-auth-form (once screenshots complete)
   - Commit and push all screenshot work

8. **Current Work**:
   
   Immediately before the summary request, I was troubleshooting port conflicts for the 03-shopping-mall screenshot generation. 
   
   **Context**: User revealed "내가 띄워둔 서버가 있어서 포트 충돌한 거야" after I attempted to start dev servers on ports 3000, 3001, and 3005.
   
   **What was being done**:
   - Checked for zombie processes using `ps aux | grep -E "next|shopping-mall|3000"`
   - Found only Playwright test processes (PIDs 2171, 2021) still running
   - Killed playwright test processes with `pkill -f "playwright test"`
   - Still had 6 processes remaining after kill attempt
   
   **Port Status**:
   - Port 3000: Not available (needed for shopping-mall)
   - Port 3001: Not available (needed for JSON Server)
   - Port 5173: Running with PID 7762 - confirmed as 01-todo-app via `node /Users/neisii/Development/playwright-project/01-todo-app/node_modules/.bin/vite`
   
   **Files involved**:
   - `03-shopping-mall/tests/screenshots.spec.ts` - Screenshot test script with API mocking
   - Port assignments modified from 3005 back to 3000 after user clarification

9. **Optional Next Step**:
   
   Need to identify which ports are available for shopping-mall before proceeding with screenshots.
   
   **Direct quote from conversation**:
   User: "shopping-mall인데 좀비 프로세스로 남아있지 않은지 확인해봐"
   User: "내가 띄워둔 서버가 있어서 포트 충돌한 거야"
   
   **Next action**: Check if user's shopping-mall server is already running on port 3000, and if so, use that existing server to run the screenshot tests instead of trying to start a new one. If not running, ask user which ports are available or if they want to start the server themselves..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
