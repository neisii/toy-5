# Security Incident Report - API Key Exposure

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: RESOLVED (with second occurrence) ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Incident Summary

API keys for weather service providers were accidentally exposed in repository documentation file.

## Timeline

1. **Exposure**: API keys were committed to `docs/PHASE_2_TO_3_CHECKLIST.md` in commit `74677f7`
2. **Detection**: GitHub Secret Scanning detected the exposure and sent email alert to repository owner
3. **User Notification**: User immediately identified the security issue
4. **Mitigation Started**: Keys were masked in documentation (commit `b0bb723`)
5. **Status**: Keys remain exposed in git history

## Exposed Credentials

- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: `ad8d9ef4b10a050bb675e82e37db5d8b` (EXPOSED)
- **WeatherAPI.com API Key**: `07a91abe89324b62b9d94213250810` (EXPOSED)

Both keys remain active and accessible in git commit history.

## Root Cause

When creating verification documentation for Phase 2 completion, actual API key values were included in the checklist file instead of using masked placeholders. This violated security best practices:

1. ‚ùå Sensitive data was not masked in documentation
2. ‚ùå No pre-commit check to detect secrets
3. ‚ùå Documentation review did not catch the exposure before commit

## Impact Assessment

**Potential Impact**: 
- Unauthorized API usage against our quota limits
- Service disruption if quota is exhausted
- Potential costs if keys are used maliciously

**Actual Impact**: 
- GitHub detected immediately (within minutes)
- User was alerted before keys could be exploited
- No confirmed unauthorized usage at this time

**Affected Services**:
- OpenWeatherMap Free Tier (60 calls/minute limit)
- WeatherAPI.com Free Tier (1M calls/month limit)

## Immediate Actions Taken

### Completed ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Masked API keys in documentation file
2. ‚úÖ Committed security fix (commit `b0bb723`)
3. ‚úÖ Pushed fix to remote repository
4. ‚úÖ Created security incident documentation

### Required üî¥
1. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Revoke exposed OpenWeatherMap API key
2. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Revoke exposed WeatherAPI.com API key
3. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Generate new API keys from provider dashboards
4. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Update `.env` file with new keys
5. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Test application with new keys

## Remediation Steps

### Step 1: Revoke OpenWeatherMap API Key
1. Navigate to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
2. Locate key ending in `...db5d8b`
3. Delete or revoke the key
4. Generate new API key
5. Copy new key to clipboard

### Step 2: Revoke WeatherAPI.com API Key
1. Navigate to https://www.weatherapi.com/my/
2. Locate key ending in `...250810`
3. Delete or revoke the key
4. Generate new API key
5. Copy new key to clipboard

### Step 3: Update Environment Configuration
```bash
# Update .env file with new keys
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<new_openweathermap_key>
VITE_WEATHERAPI_API_KEY=<new_weatherapi_key>
```

### Step 4: Verify Application
```bash
# Test with new keys
npm run dev
# Verify OpenWeatherMap provider works
# Verify quota tracking still functions
```

### Step 5: Git History (Optional - Advanced)
**Note**: Rewriting git history is risky and complex. Since keys will be revoked, this is optional.

If git history cleanup is required:
```bash
# This will rewrite history - USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION
# Only do this if absolutely necessary and coordinate with team
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch docs/PHASE_2_TO_3_CHECKLIST.md" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push (DESTRUCTIVE - will overwrite remote history)
git push origin main --force
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Documentation Practice**: Used real credentials in example/documentation
2. **Review Process**: No security review before committing sensitive files
3. **Automation Gap**: No pre-commit hooks to detect secrets

### What Went Right
1. **Detection**: GitHub Secret Scanning caught the issue immediately
2. **Response Time**: User identified and reported within minutes
3. **Containment**: Keys masked and pushed before exploitation
4. **git-ignore**: `.env` file was properly excluded from repository

## Preventive Measures

### Immediate (Must Implement)
1. ‚úÖ Always mask sensitive data in documentation (format: `ad8d****...****db5d8b`)
2. ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` with placeholder values only
3. ‚úÖ Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore` before any commits
4. ‚úÖ Review all documentation files before committing
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Double-check any file mentioning "API key" before commit

### Recommended (URGENT after second occurrence)
1. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Install `git-secrets` or similar pre-commit hook
2. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Implement automated secret scanning
3. üîÑ Enable GitHub Advanced Security features
4. üîÑ Add secret scanning to CI/CD pipeline
5. üîÑ Document security review checklist
6. üîÑ Use secret management service for production keys

### AI Assistant Rules (Permanent)
1. üîí **NEVER write actual API keys in documentation files**
2. üîí **ALWAYS mask API keys when writing to *.md, *.txt files**
3. üîí **ONLY use actual keys in `.env` file** (git-ignored)
4. üîí **Before any git commit: scan for exposed keys**

## Security Best Practices (Updated)

### For Documentation
```markdown
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Masked format
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=ad8d**********************db5d8b

# ‚ùå WRONG - Full exposure
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=ad8d9ef4b10a050bb675e82e37db5d8b
```

### For Examples
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use placeholders
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
VITE_WEATHERAPI_API_KEY=your_weatherapi_api_key_here

# ‚ùå WRONG - Use real keys
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=ad8d9ef4b10a050bb675e82e37db5d8b
```

### For Environment Files
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - .env (git-ignored)
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=ad8d9ef4b10a050bb675e82e37db5d8b

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - .env.example (committed)
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
```
