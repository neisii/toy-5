# Phase 6: Weather Accuracy Tracking - Summary

> **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
> **Date**: 2025-10-13  
> **Duration**: Single session (continued from previous planning)

---

## Overview

Phase 6 implemented a complete weather prediction accuracy tracking system to determine which weather provider has the most consistent forecasts over time. The system includes automated data collection via GitHub Actions, a comprehensive accuracy analysis UI, and a demo mode for preview.

**Ultimate Goal**: Determine which weather provider (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, Open-Meteo) has the highest prediction accuracy through 30+ days of data collection and AI-powered analysis.

---

## Completion Status

### ✅ Week 1-2: Data Collection Infrastructure

**Forecast API Integration**:
- Extended `WeatherProvider` interface with `getForecast()` method
- Implemented forecast data transformation for all 3 providers:
  - **OpenWeatherMap**: 5-day/3-hour forecast → daily aggregation
  - **WeatherAPI**: 14-day forecast API
  - **Open-Meteo**: WMO-based daily forecast
- Added `WeatherForecast` and `TemperatureForecast` domain types

**GitHub Actions Workflows** (`.github/workflows/`):
1. **collect-predictions.yml**: Daily at 00:00 UTC
   - Collects tomorrow's weather forecast from all 3 providers
   - Saves to `data/predictions/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
   
2. **collect-observations.yml**: Daily at 00:30 UTC
   - Collects today's actual weather from all 3 providers
   - Saves to `data/observations/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
   
3. **weekly-analysis.yml**: Every Monday at 01:00 UTC
   - Runs AI-powered accuracy analysis
   - Saves to `data/analysis/week-N.json`

**Data Collection Scripts** (`scripts/`):
- `collect-predictions.ts`: Forecast collection logic
- `collect-observations.ts`: Current weather collection
- `weekly-analysis.ts`: Accuracy calculation + AI analysis
- All scripts use TypeScript with `tsx` execution

**Infrastructure Fixes**:
- Created `storage.ts` utility for Node.js/browser localStorage compatibility
- Fixed GitHub Actions permissions (`contents: write`)
- Corrected git paths for monorepo structure
- Added debug logging for forecast date validation

### ✅ Week 3-4: Accuracy Dashboard UI

**Components Created**:

1. **AccuracyDashboard.vue** - Main dashboard
   - Overall summary cards (분석 기간, 최고 정확도, 평균 오차)
   - Empty state with data collection schedule info
   - Integration of all sub-components

2. **ProviderComparison.vue** - Provider comparison cards
   - 3 provider cards with detailed metrics
   - Color-coded progress bars (green/yellow/red)
   - Best provider highlighting with gradient background
   - Metrics: 온도 오차, 날씨 일치율, 습도 오차, 풍속 오차

3. **DailyAccuracyTable.vue** - Detailed daily comparison
   - Date-by-date prediction vs observation comparison
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Pagination (20 items per page)
   - Color-coded error badges

4. **AccuracyChart.vue** - Time-series visualization
   - SVG-based line chart
   - Provider-specific colors (orange/blue/green)
   - Temperature error trends over time
   - Interactive tooltips

**Navigation & Routing**:
- Installed `vue-router` for multi-page navigation
- Created `/` (HomeView) and `/accuracy` (AccuracyView) routes
- Added navigation bar with active link highlighting
- Refactored existing App.vue content to HomeView

**Data Management** (`composables/useAccuracyData.ts`):
- `loadPredictions()` / `loadObservations()` functions
- Automatic comparison calculation (prediction vs observation)
- Provider statistics calculation:
  - Average temperature error
  - Condition match rate
  - Overall score (weighted: temp 40%, condition 30%, humidity 15%, wind 15%)
- Best provider determination

### ✅ Bonus: Demo Data Mode

**Feature**: 2-week sample data generator for UI preview

**Implementation** (`data/demoAccuracyData.ts`):
- `generateDemoPredictions()`: 14 days of forecast data
- `generateDemoObservations()`: 14 days of actual weather
- Realistic provider-specific accuracy characteristics:
  - **WeatherAPI**: Best (±1°C, 85% condition match)
  - **OpenWeather**: Good temperature (±1.5°C, 75% match)
  - **Open-Meteo**: Good condition (±2°C, 80% match)

**UI Integration**:
- "📊 데모 데이터로 미리보기" button in empty state
- "✅ 데모 모드 (2주 샘플 데이터)" active indicator
- Toggle on/off functionality
- Instant data loading without API calls

**Purpose**: Allow users to preview UI functionality before actual data collection by GitHub Actions.

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Cross-Environment Compatibility
- **Problem**: `localStorage` not available in Node.js
- **Solution**: Created `storage.ts` utility with:
  - Browser: localStorage API
  - Node.js: In-memory Map
  - Seamless switching based on environment

### 2. Monorepo GitHub Actions
- **Problem**: Workflows must be in repository root, but project is in `02-weather-app/`
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved workflows to `.github/workflows/` at root
  - Added `working-directory: ./02-weather-app` to all steps
  - Used absolute paths for git operations

### 3. Forecast API Data Aggregation
- **Challenge**: Each provider has different forecast formats
- **OpenWeather**: 3-hour intervals → Calculate daily min/max/avg
- **WeatherAPI**: Native daily forecasts
- **Open-Meteo**: WMO codes with daily data
- **Solution**: Provider-specific transformation logic in adapters

### 4. Type Safety Throughout
- Strict TypeScript with domain types
- Non-null assertions for array access safety
- Computed properties with proper return types

## User Decisions Made

### 1. GitHub Actions over Local Server
- **Decision**: Use GitHub Actions for data collection (Option C variant)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Completely free (2,000 min/month)
  - Git-based version control
  - No server maintenance
  - Auto-commit workflow

### 2. Relative Consistency Analysis
- **Decision**: Compare each provider's "forecast vs own observation"
- **Rationale**: Avoid circular logic of consensus averaging
- **Note**: KMA API reserved for future (currently unavailable)

### 3. Demo Mode for UI Preview
- **User Request**: "네가 3개 날씨 제공자의 데이터 샘플을 2주치 생성해서 내가 확인할 수 있게 데모 보기 기능도 만들어줘"
- **Implementation**: 2-week realistic sample data with provider-specific characteristics
- **Result**: "데모도 아주 마음에 들어" ✅

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No Data Yet**: 
   - Workflows will start collecting data daily
   - Need 7-14 days for meaningful analysis
   - Demo mode available for immediate preview

2. **Seoul Only**:
   - Phase 6 PoC focuses on Seoul (서울)
   - Can expand to 8 cities after validation

3. **Demo Data**:
   - Hardcoded 2-week sample
   - Not connected to real data loading
   - For UI preview only

### Future Enhancements

1. **Week 2 Implementation** (Deferred to data collection phase):
   - Actual accuracy calculation logic
   - AI-powered weekly analysis with GPT-4o
   - Provider ranking algorithm

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - More chart types (bar, scatter)
   - Filter by date range
   - Export to CSV/JSON

3. **Multi-City Support**:
   - Expand to 8 Korean cities
   - City comparison view
   - Regional accuracy differences

4. **GitHub Pages Deployment**:
   - User requested to defer until project completion
   - Would enable public access to demo

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Monorepo Workflow Configuration
- **Challenge**: GitHub Actions workflows require repository root location
- **Learning**: Use `working-directory` and absolute paths for monorepo projects
- **Pattern**: Job-level `defaults.run.working-directory` + step-level overrides

### 2. Node.js vs Browser Environment
- **Challenge**: `localStorage` and `import.meta.env` are browser-only
- **Learning**: Always check environment and provide fallbacks
- **Pattern**: Utility functions with environment detection

### 3. Forecast API Differences
- **Challenge**: Each provider has different forecast formats and intervals
- **Learning**: Design flexible transformation layer in adapters
- **Pattern**: Provider-specific `transformForecastToDomain()` methods

### 4. Demo Data Value
- **Insight**: User requested demo mode as a bonus feature
- **Value**: Allows immediate UI validation without waiting for real data
- **Learning**: Consider demo/preview modes for time-dependent features
